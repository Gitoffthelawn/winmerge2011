<h2>WinMerge 0.2011.210.381 Release Notes</h2>
This is an experimental release of WinMerge 2011.<br>
It includes the following enhancements as compared to the previous stable release:
<ul class='features'>
<li><p><a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/winmerge/winimerge'>WinIMergeLib</a> is used for image comparison.
	<br>This feature was adopted from WinMerge 2.16.
<li><p>SQLite 3 database files are presented in a <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/datadiode/SQLiteCompare'>modified version</a> of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/220018/SQLite-Compare-Utility'>SQLite Compare</a>
	which allows its embedding into the WinMerge GUI.
	<br>This modified version also fixes quite a number of bugs found in the original product, and continues to work independently from WinMerge.
<li><p>As an alternative to GNU diff, you can choose among algorithms provided by LibXDiff.
	<br>In particular, you may find LibXDiff's <i>indent heuristics</i> option useful.
	<br>This feature was adopted from WinMerge 2.16.
<li><p>File transform scriptlet <i>protodec.wsc</i> can be used to decode Protobuf messages.
<li><p>The binary comparison view includes a Bookmarks menu.
<li><p>File type associations for syntax coloring are configurable in Options dialog.
<li><p>Following a suggestion made ages ago on Bitbucket, the folder compare progress dialog offers an option to send an email when ready.
<li><p>The text comparison view can be switched to <i>Table Layout</i> to achieve column-wise alignment of CSV-like files.
	<br>The detailed procedure is to select one instance of the character which the file at hand uses as its field separator, and then type Ctrl+T, or invoke the command through toolbar or menu.
	<br>If the file also reserves a character for enquoting values to allow them to include instances of the field separator character, you can tell WinMerge so by
	selecting two adjacent characters, the first one representing a field separator, and the second one representing a field enquoting character.
	<br>Hint: If the field separator follows the field enquoting character, you'd perform the selection from right to left.
	<br>Note that WinMerge 2.16's <i>Table Compare</i> feature is superior in that it allows you to adjust cell widths, and can wrap texts inside cells accordingly.
	<br>I found this feature to be quite a nightmare to implement in a way that does not mess up editing, so resorted to a simplified, tab-stop like approach.
