WinMerge 2011 was long ago forked from WinMerge, when the project was in a dead end.
Meanwhile, [winmerge.org](https://winmerge.org/) abandoned their original codebase in favor of [Takashi's fork](https://github.com/WinMerge/winmerge),
whose development is driven forward with enthusiasm. Development of WinMerge 2011 has not entirely ceased, but is a sporadic business.

This project was previously hosted on Bitbucket at https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011 but Bitbucket removed all Mercurial repositories.

PortableApps.com supports WinMerge 2011, although their version is currently (as of 2021 January) a bit out of date as compared to this GitHub repo.
